  <h2>How do I use gravitron?</h2>
  <p>Documentation is provided in the pdf manual, which you can also open from the 'Help' menu - look there for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>The basic process for taking/entering a gravity tie:
    <ul>
        <li>Select a ship and a station from the dropdown menus.</li>
        <li>Enter and save your name as the person taking the tie.</li>
        <li>Measure water height at the pier three times, with ~30 minutes elapsing between measurements. Enter each measurement when it is taken and click "save" to timestamp the value.</li>
        <li>If taking a land tie, toggle the land tie switch to "ON". Enter the land tie metadata (ship location, etc) and take the counts measurements with the land meter. Load a calibration file for the meter, and press the "Calculate land tie" button when all the information is entered.</li>
        <li>Load a gravimeter file with the "Select DGS file" button. The file should be for a time period which spans all of the water height measurements at the pier.</li>
        <li>Press "Compute bias" to calculate the tie.</li>
        <li>Press "Output tie report" to save the tie information to a txt file, and/or "Save current tie" to write the information to a TOML file. The TOML file can be re-read into the app later to add or modify information.</li>
    </ul>
