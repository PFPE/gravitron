## gravitron!

gravitron[^1] [^2] is an electron app for taking gravity ties, written specifically to handle DGS instrumnents on UNOLS vessels. 

Documentation can be found in docs/main.pdf (also accessible within the app, from the "Help" menu).

### Installation
The packaged application can be found on the "Releases" page of this repository. Mac and Windows versions are not signed, so your OS's security may not let you install them.

An alternative to the packaged versions is to [install node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer, download and unpack the source code from here, run `npm ci` in the source code directory to install dependencies, and then run `npm start` to open the application.

### Questions?
Contact PFPE (pfpe-internal(at)whoi.edu) with issues, comments, suggestions, etc. Feel free to open an issue or a PR if you wish to contribute to the code.
